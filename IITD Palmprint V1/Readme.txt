Description of the IIT Delhi Touchless Palmprint Database version 1.0
=======================================================

This touchless palmprint image database mainly consists of the hand images collected from the students and staff at IIT Delhi, India. This database has been acquired in
the Biometrics Research Laboratory during January 2006 - July 2007 using a digital CMOS camera. The acquired images were saved in bitmap format.
This database contains left and right hand images from more than 230 subjects, using a very simple touchless imaging setup, and made available freely to the researchers. 
All the subjects in the database are in the age group 14-56 years and voluntarily contributed at least 5 hand image samples from each of the hands. In addition to the acquired 
whole hand images, automatically segmented and normalized palmprint regions are also made available. 

Organization of Database
========================
The acquired database is saved in two folders: (1) Right Hand and (2) Left Hand. In addition, a new folder 'Segmented' is also made available. This folder contains 
automatically segmented and normalized images from each of the two hands from more than 230 users. Each of the 800 x 600 pixel images is named as 'XXX_Y.bmp., where XXX
represents user identification number and Y represents image sample number.

Usage of Database
========================
This database is only available for research and noncommercial purposes. Commercial distribution or any act related to commercial use of this database is strictly
prohibited. Kindly acknowledge all the publicly available publications/work employing this database with the following acknowledgement:

***************************************************************
The database was updated in December 2013 and the updated version of database now has original colour images (instead of grayscale images available earlier) and fixes
some incorrect labels. This updated version of database still has images from 230 subjects and the fisrt 229 subjects (left and right hands) images are from same subjects.
